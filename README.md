## General info

In this project, I will be building my own club group page that will dynamically respond as the screen size is adjusted!  
The webpage will be for a local club. Either real or imaginary.   
My project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools I have learned.  
Such as: 
* using percentages and relative units, such as em and rem, in the CSS to size and position page elements. 
* Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size. 
* incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen. Changing page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
