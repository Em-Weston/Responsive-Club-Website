## General info

In this project, I will be building my own club group page that will dynamically respond as the screen size is adjusted!  
The webpage will be for a local club. Either real or imaginary.   
My project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools I have learned.  
Such as: 
* using percentages and relative units, such as em and rem, in the CSS to size and position page elements. 
* Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size. 
* incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen. Changing page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
​
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS
* Git 
* GitHub
	
## Project Status
Project is: *Complete* 

I choose to make my project for a imaginary local motorcycle club.    
I'm really pleased with how this project came out. The grid layout worked really well.
The white background, beautiful images, and big bold text is visually appealing.  
As required, I used a grid layout with %, rems and fn measurements. This made the project easy to make responsive.   
To really make the mobile layout smooth, I used media queries to re-arrange, re-size and hide some of the images.   

## Room For Improvement

As I work through this project, I will list any areas that can be improved.  
I will also add TODO's for the future.   
Room For Improvement: 
 * When viewed on a mobile screen, the nav bar isn't displayed. It would be better to have the nav bar displayed, but either in a column layout at the top, and not fixed. Or use small logos. (eg, twitter logo)
 * Add a club email sign up link to the page.
 * Other extra sections could be 'photographs' or 'blog'.
